The first column in this line output is the line count. This is the result of
running:

cat test_missing.txt | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | awk '{if ($1 > 1) print $0}'

This means that it would be that it would be very improbable of achieving 100%
on this testing data as the best one could do is choose at random from one of the
occurrences that are listed here.

In total there are 520 lines that are repeats, which is 7.5% of the total number
of lines in test_missing.txt
